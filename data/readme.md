Data from a recent priming of pop-out study (Gökce, et al., 2014, FIPS, [article 688](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00688/full)).

There are 2 DAT files per subject (A and B). This is bcs we had 2 sessions where S-R mappings were counterbalanced. The coding of the result files is as follows (see below). The relevant position, color, and orientation priming effects can be found in rows 14-16. BTW: „TT“ means that the target in the current trial n is positioned at the the very same location as in the previous trial n-1. „TD“ means that the current target appears at a previous distractor location. „TN“ means that the current target appears at a previously empty (neutral) location. Usually, we assess facilitatory and inhibitory position priming by comparing TT and TD with TN, respectively.

#1 / trial (1-896; 8 blocks 112 trials each)
#2 / configuration (1: square display; 2: diamond display)
#3 / configuration2 (1-4 square; 5-8 diamond)
#4 / target side (0: vertical, 1:left, 2:right)
#5 / target position (1-8)
#6-8 / distractor positions (1-8)
#9 / target color (0: red; 1: green)
#10 / target orientation (0: notch at top; 1: notch at bottom)
#11-13 / distractor orientations (0-1)
#14 / target position priming (1: TT, 2: TD; 3: TN)
#15 / target color priming (0: same color target; 1: different color target)
#16 / target orientation priming (0: same orientation; 1: different orientation)
#17 / reaction times
#18 / response errors (0: no error; 1: error; 2:time-out trial)
